#Use data from the stringr library called sentences

library(stringr)
head(sentences)
length(sentences)

#1 - Find words that come after articles 'a' and 'the'

#2 - Find words that come after a number and pull the complete number and word that follows.

#3 - Find all contractions.

#4 - In the dataset if you want to find only sentences with color and used the list c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple")
#you will notice that just using literals you will capture words like 'flickered' because they contain the word 'red'.
#Create a regular expression that corrects this problem.
